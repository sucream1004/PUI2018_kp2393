## Assignment 1: Look into PLUTO data using pandas focusing on LandUse
* I have explored PLUTO data using pandas [Assignment1_ipynb](https://github.com/sucream1004/PUI2018_kp2393/blob/master/HW6_kp2393/Assignment1_kp2393.ipynb)

## Assignment 2: SQL in ipynb and python 2, 3 compatibility
* Looking into how to use SQL in ipynb from data from cartodb. Also, I tried to make code compatible but could not make it at pd.read_csv with stingIO. There is issue with urllib.urlencode. ipynb is here [Assignment2_ipynb](https://github.com/sucream1004/PUI2018_kp2393/blob/master/HW6_kp2393/Assignment2_kp2393.ipynb)
